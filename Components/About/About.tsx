 Hi, I&apos;m Mostafa Shawky, a passionate and creative Front-end Developer from Giza, Egypt. I specialize in transforming design concepts into interactive, user-friendly web experiences. Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, I have built a diverse portfolio that includes food delivery platforms, e-commerce sites,and dynamic web applications.
My expertise lies in crafting seamless interfaces and integrating modern animations to create engaging user experiences. I am always eager to stay at the forefront of front-end technologies, ensuring my work remains cutting-edge.
When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll likely find me immersed in video games or catching up on sleep. I&apos;m always excited to take on new challenges and bring innovative ideas to life. Feel free to explore my portfolio, and don&apos;t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
